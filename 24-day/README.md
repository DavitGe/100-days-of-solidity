#### Inheritance Tree üå≥

Before we embark on our exploration, let‚Äôs take a moment to understand the inheritance tree we‚Äôll be working with:

```
A
/ \
B C
\ /
D
```

Here, we have four contracts: A, B, C, and D. Contract A is the parent of both B and C, while contract D inherits from both B and C. This inheritance structure sets the stage for our exploration of calling parent contracts.

#### Directly Calling Parent Contracts üìû

In Solidity, you have the power to call functions defined in a parent contract directly from a child contract. This allows for code reuse and easy extension of functionality. Let‚Äôs examine the provided code samples to understand how this works.

Contract A sets the foundation by defining two functions: `foo()` and `bar()`. It also emits an event called `Log` to log function calls. The `foo()` function emits a log message ‚ÄúA.foo called‚Äù when invoked, and the `bar()` function emits a log message ‚ÄúA.bar called‚Äù.

Contract B, being a child contract of A, overrides the `foo()` and `bar()` functions. In its overridden `foo()` function, it emits a log message ‚ÄúB.foo called‚Äù and invokes the `foo()` function of contract A using `A.foo()`. Similarly, the overridden `bar()` function emits a log message ‚ÄúB.bar called‚Äù and invokes the `bar()` function of the parent contract using `super.bar()`.

Contract C, another child contract of A, follows a similar pattern. It overrides the `foo()` and `bar()` functions, emitting log messages specific to C, and calling the `foo()` function of contract A. The overridden `bar()` function emits a log message ‚ÄúC.bar called‚Äù and invokes the `bar()` function of the parent contract using `super.bar()`.

Lastly, contract D inherits from both B and C. In contract D, we override the `foo()` and `bar()` functions once again, but this time, we call `super.foo()` and `super.bar()` to invoke the respective functions from the immediate parent contracts.

#### The Mighty `super` Keyword ‚ö°

Solidity empowers us with the `super` keyword, which allows for explicit invocation of functions from immediate parent contracts. When using `super`, Solidity ensures that the most derived function (the one overridden in the child contract) is called, followed by subsequent functions in the inheritance hierarchy.

Let‚Äôs analyze the behavior of the `foo()` and `bar()` functions in contract D:

```solidity
function foo() public override(B, C) {
super.foo();
}

function bar() public override(B, C) {
super.bar();
}
```

In the `foo()` function of contract D, we specify `override(B, C)`. This instructs Solidity to call the overridden `foo()` functions from contracts B and C in that order. By using `super.foo()`, we ensure that the `foo()` function from contract C is called first, followed by the `foo()` function from contract A.

Similarly, in the `bar()` function of contract D, we specify `override(B, C)`. This ensures that the overridden `bar()` functions from contracts B and C are called in the specified order when we use `super.bar()`. The chain of function calls goes from contract C to contract B and finally reaches contract A.

#### Analyzing the Smart Contracts üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now that we have an understanding of how to call parent contracts in Solidity, let‚Äôs analyze, compare, and comment on the provided smart contracts: contracts A, B, C, and D.

```solidity
// SPDX-license-identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
contract A{
  event log(string message);
  function foo() public virtual {
    emit Log("A.foo called");
  }
  function bar() public virtual {
    emit Log("A.bar called");
  }
}
contract B is A {
  function foo() public virtual override {
    emit Log("B.foo called");
    A.foo();
  }
  function bar() public virtual override{
    emit Log("B.bar called");
    super.bar();
  }
}
contract C is A {
  function foo() public virtual override {
    emit Log("C.bar called");
    A.foo();
  }
  function bar() public override(B, C){
    emit Log("C.bar called");
    super.bar();
  }
}
contract D is B,C{
  function foo() public override(B, C){
    super.foo();
  }
  function bar() public override(B, C){
    super.bar();
  }
}
```

Contract A serves as the foundation by defining the `foo()` and `bar()` functions, along with emitting log messages. These functions are meant to be overridden by child contracts.

Contract B, as a child contract of A, overrides the `foo()` and `bar()` functions, emits log messages specific to B, and calls the `foo()` function of contract A using `A.foo()`.

Contract C, another child contract of A, follows a similar pattern. It overrides the `foo()` and `bar()` functions, emits log messages specific to C, and calls the `foo()` function of contract A.

Contract D inherits from both B and C. In contract D, we override the `foo()` and `bar()` functions once again. By calling `super.foo()` and `super.bar()`, we invoke the respective functions from the immediate parent contracts. This results in the order of function calls: C, B, A for the `foo()` function, and C, B, A for the `bar()` function.
