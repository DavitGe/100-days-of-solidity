## üîç Understanding If/Else Statements:

If/else statements in Solidity, much like in other programming languages, allow developers to control the flow of their code based on specific conditions. These conditions can be evaluated using various comparison operators, such as less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (==), and more. The if/else statements execute different blocks of code depending on whether the conditions are met or not.

### üåê Syntax:

The basic syntax of an if/else statement in Solidity is as follows:

```
if (condition) {
// code to be executed if the condition is true
} else if (condition) {
// code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
// code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

In the above syntax, the ‚Äúcondition‚Äù represents the logical expression that is evaluated to determine which block of code should be executed. Multiple else if blocks can be used to check additional conditions, and the else block is optional and executes when none of the previous conditions are true.
